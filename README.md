# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game built with React and Vite, where two players take turns rolling dice and accumulating scores. The goal is to reach a preset max score first, but be carefulâ€”if both dice show the same number, your score for that turn resets to 0!

## Game Rules

- **Set Max Score**: On the first page, players can set their max score, which determines the score threshold for winning the game.
- **Turns**: Players take turns by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
  - Each player gets **5 rolls** per turn.
  - After each roll, the total value of both dice is added to the player's score.
  - If both dice show the **same number**, the player's score for that turn resets to **0**.
- **Hold**: Players can click the "Hold" button to keep their score for that turn and pass the turn to the other player.
- **Winning**: The first player to reach the set **max score** wins the game.
